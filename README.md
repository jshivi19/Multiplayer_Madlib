# Multiplayer Mad Lib Game

A fun multiplayer Mad Lib game that runs on a local network using SSL encryption. Players connect to a server, answer creative questions, and vote for the funniest responses!

## üéÆ How It Works

1. Players connect to the server using their username
2. The server presents a Mad Lib question with one player's name randomly inserted
3. All players submit their creative answers
4. Players vote for their favorite answer
5. Points are awarded based on votes received
6. After 3 rounds, the player with the most points wins!

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- SSL certificates (cert.pem, key.pem, ca.pem)
- Local network connection
- Minimum 2 players to start the game

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Generate SSL Certificates

First, you need to create SSL certificates for secure communication:

```bash
# Generate private key
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048

# Generate certificate signing request
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out cert.csr

# Generate self-signed certificate
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in cert.csr -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem

# Create CA certificate (copy cert.pem for simple setup)
cp cert.pem ca.pem
```

### 2. Configure Network Settings

Update the `HOST` variable in both server and client files:

**Server (server.py):**
```python
HOST = "192.168.247.85"  # Replace with your server's IP address
PORT = 65432
```

**Client (client.py):**
```python
HOST = "192.168.247.85"  # Must match server IP
PORT = 65432
```

### 3. File Structure

Ensure your project directory contains:
```
multiplayer-madlib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cert.pem
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ key.pem
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ca.pem
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## üöÄ Running the Game

### Start the Server

1. Run the server on the host machine:
```bash
python server.py
```

2. The server will display:
```
Server is listening on 192.168.247.85:65432
```

### Connect Clients

1. On each player's machine, run:
```bash
python client.py
```

2. Enter your username when prompted
3. Wait for other players to join

### Game Flow

1. **Minimum Players**: Game starts when at least 2 players join
2. **Rounds**: 3 rounds total
3. **Questions**: Random Mad Lib questions with player names inserted
4. **Voting**: Players vote for the funniest answers
5. **Scoring**: Points awarded based on votes received
6. **Winner**: Player with most points after 3 rounds wins

## üéØ Game Rules

- Players cannot vote for their own answers (optional - can be enabled in client code)
- Each vote gives 1 point to the selected answer's author
- In case of a tie, multiple winners are declared
- Disconnected players are automatically removed from active rounds

## üîí Security Features

- SSL/TLS encryption for all client-server communication
- Certificate-based authentication
- Secure socket connections

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

### Server Settings (server.py)
```python
no_of_rounds = 3        # Number of game rounds
minimum_players = 2     # Minimum players to start
HOST = "IP_ADDRESS"     # Server IP address
PORT = 65432           # Server port
```

### Client Settings (client.py)
```python
game_code = "1234"     # Game room identifier
HOST = "IP_ADDRESS"    # Server IP address
PORT = 65432          # Server port
```

## üìù Sample Questions

The game includes 21 pre-written Mad Lib questions such as:
- "If [player] could have any superpower, it would be the ability to __________."
- "[player] secret talent is juggling flaming __________."
- "If [player] were a superhero, his arch-nemesis would be the evil __________."

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Refused:**
- Ensure the server is running
- Check if the IP address and port are correct
- Verify firewall settings allow connections on the specified port

**SSL Certificate Errors:**
- Ensure all certificate files (cert.pem, key.pem, ca.pem) are present
- Regenerate certificates if they're corrupted or expired
- Make sure certificate permissions are readable

**Game Not Starting:**
- Check if minimum number of players (2) have joined
- Verify all players are properly connected
- Look at server console for error messages

**Player Disconnection:**
- Disconnected players are automatically removed from active rounds
- Game continues with remaining players
- Check network stability and connection quality
